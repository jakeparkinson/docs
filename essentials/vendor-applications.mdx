## Overview

Every market includes a professional vendor application form with standard questions pre-configured. You can customize the form with additional questions and market-specific information to collect exactly what you need from potential vendors.

## Accessing the Application Form

Access your application form directly from your market's management page:

<Frame caption="Market Management Page - Click the 'Application Form' card to view and edit your form">
  <img
    src="/images/market-management-page.png"
    alt="Market Management Dashboard"
  />
</Frame>

## Application Form Preview

When you open the application form, you'll see a preview of what vendors will see:

<Frame caption="Application Form Preview">
  <img
    src="/images/application-form-preview.png"
    alt="Application Form Preview"
  />
</Frame>

<Note>
  Standard questions are automatically included in every application form to
  ensure you collect essential vendor information. These standard questions
  cannot be removed.
</Note>

### Adding Custom Questions

Click the "Add Question" button to create additional questions. Choose from these question types:

1. **Text Answer**

   - Free-form text input
   - Best for detailed responses
   - Example: "Describe your products in detail"

2. **Multiple Choice**

   - Creates checkbox options
   - Add multiple options for vendors to select from
   - Example: "Which booth size do you prefer?"

3. **Yes/No**
   - Simple yes or no response
   - Best for clear requirements
   - Example: "Do you need electricity?"

<Note>
  You can mark any custom question as required to ensure vendors provide the
  information you need.

## Managing Applications

### Setting Deadlines
