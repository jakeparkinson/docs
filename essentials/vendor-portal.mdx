## Overview

The Vendor Portal is a centralized dashboard where vendors can manage all aspects of their market participation. From tracking applications to managing booth assignments and accessing resources, everything vendors need is in one place.

## Accessing the Portal

Vendors automatically get access to the portal when they submit their first market application. This creates their Seen Markets vendor account, allowing them to:

- Manage multiple markets
- Keep their vendor profile updated
- Access all market resources
